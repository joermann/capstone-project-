# capstone-project-My project is a potential data base or web site which is intended for hobbiest, jobbers, and auto shops. With it, they can reference and cross reference for part compatibilty over the years and generations of automobiles. Currenty most purchase web sites offer a year, make, model method of finding parts. However these don't allow the user to see all options. If they have a modified vehicle it maybe impossible to know if the part the web site chooses for them will fit. There is not much cross referencing on the gambit of years, generations, and compatibility as well as options one may find in the field.
